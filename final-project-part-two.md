# User research 

## Target audience
My audience for this particular presentation can be categorized into three distinct groups: bicyclists, drivers, and Washington DC policymakers

### Bicyclists
One of the key focuses of this presentation is to ensure that bicyclists are keeping themselves safe on the road. By educating them about the risks of regular commute, it may make them more aware of their surroundings when they use their vehicle. I also intend to educate them on important protections that bike lanes _less_ associated with accidents have, making them more conscious of which routs they might want to take. I would want their singular action to educate themselves on the bikelane protections I cover in my presentation (link). Though this is primarily aimed at the DC bicyclist population, all bikers can make use of this information.

### Drivers
While bicyclists need to be careful while riding, drivers need to be aware of they share the road with. Not only do I hope that drivers who see my presentation can be more cognizant of safety when being alongside bikers, but I also want to draw their attention to courses they can take in order to mitigate driving techniques that may result in more bicycle accidents (link). 

### Policymakers
Most importantly, in order to implement the changes that I want into the infrastructure of Washington DC, I need to convince lawmakers of the problem existing. An action I want them to take is to call the office of Muriel Bowser, mayor of DC, and ask them to push forward the Zero Vision Goal, safety measures meant to make bikers and pedestrians safer. This goal has been slowly de-prioritized over the last year, policymakers must put it back in the spotlight.

## Identifying Interview Representatives

I wanted to choose three people that represented a wide demographic of people I want to interview: bikers, drivers, and an individual in the field of public policy. I found friends/family that fit three archetypes: One who regularly bikes and lives in a large metropolitan city in the United States, One who regularly drives and lives in Washington DC, and one individual is a Political Science graduate and has worked in public office. I wanted to get a biker from DC but I unfortunately did not have any one to contact that fit the description. I believed using these three interviewees as substitutes for my target audience could influence feedback in those 3 key areas.

## Interview script
 
| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|**Make the graphs being used to compare Washington DC to other parts of the country clear and obvious in regard to how dangerous Washingston DC is relative to the rest of the country.**|- What message do you think this (these) graph(s) are trying to portray? Do you believe that there are any parts of this graph that could be improved? Do you think the color of the graphs are used appropriately to visualize the data? |
|**Is the call to action effective in making the audience want to act on the topic issue.**|If you were a biker/driver/policymaker, would you do any of the actions I've described in my presentation? What do you like/don't like about the suggested actions? Is there anything the presentation could have done more effectively to make the call to actions better/is there something that is done well and I should emphasize more?|
|**Is the story structure effective?**|Are you engaged in the story that's been told so far? What's the main conflict I'm addressing? What do you like about the story? What did you not like? As someone who does not line in Washington DC, did you still gain insight or learn something new about bicycle safety?|
