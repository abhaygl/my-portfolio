# User research 

## Target audience
My audience for this particular presentation can be categorized into three distinct groups: bicyclists, drivers, and Washington DC policymakers

### Bicyclists
One of the key focuses of this presentation is to ensure that bicyclists are keeping themselves safe on the road. By educating them about the risks of regular commute, it may make them more aware of their surroundings when they use their vehicle. I also intend to educate them on important protections that bike lanes _less_ associated with accidents have, making them more conscious of which routs they might want to take. I would want their singular action to educate themselves on the bikelane protections I cover in my presentation. Though this is primarily aimed at the DC bicyclist population, all bikers can make use of this information.

### Drivers
While bicyclists need to be careful while riding, drivers need to be aware of they share the road with. Not only do I hope that drivers who see my presentation can be more cognizant of safety when being alongside bikers, but I also want to draw their attention to courses they can take in order to mitigate driving techniques that may result in more bicycle accidents. 

### Policymakers
Most importantly, in order to implement the changes that I want into the infrastructure of Washington DC, I need to convince lawmakers of the problem existing. An action I want them to take is to call the office of Muriel Bowser, mayor of DC, and ask them to push forward the Zero Vision Goal, safety measures meant to make bikers and pedestrians safer. This goal has been slowly de-prioritized over the last year, policymakers must put it back in the spotlight.

## Identifying Interview Representatives

I wanted to choose three people that represented a wide demographic of people I want to interview: bikers, drivers, and an individual in the field of public policy. I found friends/family that fit three archetypes: One who regularly bikes and lives in a large metropolitan city in the United States, One who regularly drives and lives in Washington DC, and one individual is a Political Science graduate and has worked in public office. I wanted to get a biker from DC but I unfortunately did not have any one to contact that fit the description. I believed using these three interviewees as substitutes for my target audience could influence feedback in those 3 key areas.

## Interview script
 
| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|**Make the graphs being used to compare Washington DC to other parts of the country clear and obvious in regard to how dangerous Washingston DC is relative to the rest of the country.**|- What message do you think this (these) graph(s) are trying to portray? Do you believe that there are any parts of this graph that could be improved?|
|**Is my presentation effective in making the audience want to act on the topic issue.**|If you were a biker/driver/policymaker, would you feel a need to dosomething about the issues I've described in my presentation? What do you like/don't like about the suggested actions? Is there anything the presentation could have done more effectively to make the call to actions better/is there something that is done well and I should emphasize more?|
|**Is the story structure effective?**|Are you engaged in the story that's been told so far? What's the main conflict I'm addressing? Did you still gain insight or learn something new about bicycle safety?|

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|What message do you think this (these) graph(s) are trying to portray?|I think it is trying to show how bad bike accidents are in DC and that there are certain places where it's worse and better.|I thought that DC was super friendly to bikers, but these graphs are showing me that there's still a lot of accidents.|Infrastructure development lacking in DC has led to preventable biker injuries.|
|What's the main conflict I'm addressing?|Bicycle crashes in DC are high and improving infrastructure will mitigate that|There are a lot of Bike accidents and there needs to be more safety lanes and barriers.|There hasn't been adequate construction of bike infrastructure in high traffic areas for biking.|
|Do you believe that there are any parts of these graphs that could be improved?|the colors were pretty flat in the actual graphs themselves, it didn't convey a sense of urgency to me.|I didn't like the color. I also don't think there was enough text to tell your story well. If you're going to rely more on your graphs, I think there needs to be more visualizations for your solution of imporving infrastructure.|The actual presentation lacked a bit of creativity. I feel like you could do this on PowerPoint. Maybe try something visually intresting like having graphs fold into each other. Also on that note, graphs for US and DC crashes over time should be one graph!|
|If you were a biker/driver/policymaker, would you feel a need to do something about the issues I've described in my presentation?|As a biker, I already knew about the specifics on bike lane safety, but your presentation made me realize how important it is to educate the public on the specifics.|Yes of course. I didn't know it was so bad in my own city. I don't know if I have the time to do something about it though|Yes, I think it's really important for policynmakers, especially in a city like DC to act on subject matters like this.|
|What do you like/don't like about the suggested actions?|You told me that the bike lane information was the main thing you wanted me to learn? I already knew that. I think it would be important to have something I could read or subscribe to that is meant _for_ bikers in particular|I don't have time to take a course that's several hours long, plus I think I'm fairly careful on the road myself.|I think that this would be good for policymakers to know which politician to call, but if this is directed towards making a specific _action_ I think you need to tell policymakers exactly which bills are being brought forward in a legislative body and how they should vote.|
|Is there anything the presentation could have done more effectively to make the call to actions better/is there something that is done well and I should emphasize more?|I think something more about the risks in Washington DC in particular. Maybe an anecdote or a story I can follow?|I don't really know what I'm supposed to do with the information you give me about bike safety. Is there anyway I can learn about what I should do without taking a long course?|You should have some news event in DC that reflects the problem in real life, maybe an individual who suffered a preventable injury and how infrastructure improvements could have saved him.|
|Are you engaged in the story that's been told so far?|Yes, it's pretty dramatic and the numbers paint a good picture, I think it needs some personality.|I think so, but I think I would be more engaged if I had more to read about the scenario. I would also really like the parts about bike safety and how I could help to be longer.|Yes, I think this would be a great policymaker presentation, just be more specific on a bill that they would need to support.|
|Did you still gain insight or learn something new about bicycle safety?|Not really, but the numbers made me think more about the extent of issues in the US and DC in particular.|Yes, especially since I live in DC.|Yes. I think policymakers have change that is easy to see needs to be made here.|


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Conflict and Story is Clear, but it Could Use More Personality|Everyone seems to clearly understand the point of my visualizations. I think going forward I might have a news event or story that could peak interest and make my conflict more tangible|
|Visuals are slightly boring|I think I'll be making the primary color of the visualization slowly grow darker overtime and then lighter for the resolution, perhaps from blue to red to green. I will also combine the two graphs I have for my comparison of DC and the US. I also intend to add animations that loop graphs over each other, such as zooming in to a data point in the map to show the lack of infrastructure.|
|Calls to action need to be improved|I might change my call to actions and make them a bit simpler. Right now, the actions I have feel like a chore to perform. I need a simple, one click initial solution as part of my resolution.|
|There should be more graphs for my _Resolution_ portion of the story|I'm going to analyze the dataset of "Bike Lanes in DC" some more to find some more trends. Right now, I'm not analyzing very far and I think looking at making a graph that directly correlates information in "Bike Lanes" with information in "Crashes in DC" (through something like a line graph) would be more effective of a comparison|                                                                               |
