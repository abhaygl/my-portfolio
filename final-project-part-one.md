# Outline

## Project Summary
Washington DC is a city famous for many things: it's home of the White House, the Lincoln Memorial, the National Mall, just to name a few. But an especially unique part of the city that doesn't jump immediately to mind is its bicycles. In 2023, a report by _CBS'_ WUSA network found that Washington DC ranked as the 5th most bike-friendly city in the United States, with the city installing more than 2000 bike racks and installing 100 miles of bike lanes between 2010 and 2023 (). The city also has the second highest bicyclists per capita in the nation according to _ (). This sort of focus on public infrastructure is why I personally chose the city as my home following my undergraduate education; I grew up outside of the states and feel at home in the walkable and bikeable city streets of the nation's capitol. However, bike accessibility in a car dominated culture opens up one fear above all else: **accidents**. 

Despite the efforts the city has made in increasing accessibility for biking, bicycle related accidents in the city have grown drastically since 2015 according to DC Open Data (DCOD). Between 2016 and 2017, there was an average of ~600 cyclists injured or killed in crashes across the city (). Though the pandemic had a marked impact on the number of injuries, as people were forced to stay indoors, numbers of injuries/fatalities in the post-COVID era are far greater than any time before 2016 according to the same DCOD Database.

The goal of my project is to inform an audience of the dangers of bicycle accidents in DC. I want to show them the prevelance of biking in DC compared to other countries in the US, show the number of bicycle accidents (and its relativity to comparable cities) and finally call to action what they can do to in order to make the problem preventable in the city.

## Project Structure
My audience for this project is fellow Washington DC residents, bikers, drivers, and government policymakers. I want residents to be more informed about bike safety in their area, I want bikers to know the risk of their mode of transportation in the city, I want drivers to be cautious of those biking around them, and I want policymakers to be informed on biking infrastructure goals to ensure the safety of bikers and drivers alike. My project aims to be split up into 3 distinct parts, a Setup, a Conflict, and a Resolution.

### Setup: Washington DC has a lot of bikers
In this section, I'll inform the audience about DC and its biking culture. I'll talk about statistics and data related to how many people bike in the city, how much the city endorses it, and how it stacks up compared to other cities in the United States.

### Conflict: Those bikers have a lot of accidents
Here, I'll talk about how many accidents occur in DC. I want to use this section for visuals that leave an impact on how many people are injured or fatally wounded as a result of biking accidents. I want to go through how this has changed over time and the reasons for why those changes may have happened.

### Resolution: Improving infrastructure and educating drivers can reduce those accidents
This is the resolution, where I discuss the efforts that have been made to save lives and what the audience can do to help. I will provide links to help support non-profits that are dealing with the issue, numbers for DC local government that can be called to voice concerns, and educational sources to keep the audience informed on the facts.

Here I have a rough outline of what I would like my storyboard to be. I start with a bar graph that compares DC bikers to US Average ones, and then transition to highlighting how many of those bikers are at risk. I wanted to use a "body count" visual because I believe it is impactful in showing that lives are on the line. I then used a map to detail where accidents happen and how DC accidents for bikes are worse over time compared to the US. Finally, I showed an example of protected bike paths to show how changing infrastructure may be the solution to fixing bike accidents. This rought story board goes through my setup (establishing DC's biker pool), the conflict (the accidents themselves) and the resolution (changing infrastructure).

# The data
So far, I have found three datasets that are pertinent to this particular project. 

First, I will be using a dataset that covers all vehicle crashes in DC over a 40 year period. This is a dataset from Open Data DC and it covers a variety of details of all crashes in DC, including type of vehicle(s), street of occurance, passengers, type of crash, and so on. I intend to use this dataset in order to look at crash data related to bicycle accidents and be able to compare their data to non bicycle accidents. I also intend to use the geolocation feature to show exactly where bike crashes happen in DC.

Second, I will be using a dataset that documents all vehicle accidents in the United States over a 7 year period. My goal is to use this dataset to compare the bicycle accidents over time compared to DC and pick the most recent year statistics (2023) and compare the details of those crashes to DC's 2023 data.

Finally, I will be using a dataset that has existing details of bike infrastructure in DC. I aim to use this particular data in order to show how DC could either improve their existing infrastructure or which areas need new infrastructure. it will allow me to focus my plan to action towards specific goals and tasks, like which areas needed to be reported at a representative's office and whether there's any correlation between details of existing infrastructure and the high/low rate of crashes.

# Method and medium
I plan to be using Shorthand and Tableau for the presentation of my data. I want to use tableau in order to analyze the data and create a dashboard with my chosen visuals. I will then use shorthand in order to display these visuals. I want to use Shorthand as my I plan to create a scrolling website that clearly telly a story in three parts.
