# Makeover Monday
In a world full of different data visualizations, not everyone is going to think of modelling data the exact same way. There's all sorts of graphs, maps, and designs that can be used to represent the same dataset. That's the premise of the journey I went on in this page. Join me for Makeover Monday, where I choose a visualization from a website or database and redesign it to tell the story a completely different way.

## 1. Choosing a Visualization
First, I needed to choose a visualization. [Makeover Monday](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/) has a vast number of graphs and charts from a variety of sources that people redesign. Though many of them were interesting, including a table looking at congressional staff earnings and a scrolling bubble plot examining the pay gap in US Soccer, I decided to choose a graph displaying the differences in the average price for 1GB of data in countries around the world. I chose it because every time I go to my parent's home country of India, I notice that the price of data is EXTREMELY low compared to the United States, and I've always wondered how other countries stack up compared to the US as well.

## 2. Critiquing the visualization
Next, I examined the visualization for its benefits and drawbacks. I submitted a Google Form detailing my specific thoughts on the graphics, as seen below:

## 3. Wireframe
After I disected the visualization that was, I started to draw up what it could be. I wanted to make it a lot simpler, so I decided to sketch up a bar graph and a treemap. I thought both of them would be effective at displaying a lot of information in a visually appealing yet legible way. Plus, I knew I wanted to use color, and this would allow me to do that.

After drawing up both, I decided to go with a bar graph. The treemap was interesting, but I ran into the same issue conceptually where the numbers more similar to each other were not clearly larger or smaller than one another.

## 4.
I discussed my plans with two groups of people. One group was 2 fellow college students my age. They went to different universities than mine and came from very different disciplines. There were two individuals I consulted independently, all students in their early 20s pursuing degrees in Compsci and Law respectively. The second group was 2 peers from my Data Visualization class. They were both slightly older than me, mid-20s, completing their masters degrees.

For each person I talked to, I followed the same script:
_- What is this graph about?_
_- What story do you think this graph is trying to tell?_
_- Who is this graph for?_
_- What information pops out to you?_
_- What information do you think about, but the graph fails to provide?_
_- What parts about the design do you like or not like?_

I showed them both the sketch and a mock-up I quickly threw together on tableau, pictured below:

Here is a paraphrasing of all the feedback I recieved.

_Law Student, early-20s:_
I can tell that the graph is meant to tell me about the cost of average data plans. I like that the colors are indicative of the price. I feel like there's too much information on the screen. I think I'm meant to know about the biggest and smallest numbers, but scrolling between everything doesn't let me compare them. I don't know if I'd use this, but I can see how someone interested in the topic could make use of this.

_Compsci Student, early-20s:_
