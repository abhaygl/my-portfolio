# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

  There were a significant amount of changes made to the final project after part II, particularly having to do with the pace of the story, the color palette, and one of the data visualizations that was important to the story.
  The pace of the story was changed fairly significantly, particularly in the opening. One of the concerns expressed by Katelin was that the reason for why Washington DC was the focus of the case was not completely clear. In order to make this part a bit more satisfying, I covered how the government of Washington DC advertises the safety of bicycling incorrectly, and how it’s important to cover this issue in DC particularly because of the misleading narrative regarding the city made by the officials.
  The color palette in the previous edition was fairly basic, in the sense that it was a single palette throughout: blue and tan. Now, I changed it to transition from blue/white, to black/red, and finally to green/white. I did this in order to fit with the emotions I am trying to convey in the narrative: the positive of increased biking in DC, the negative of the bicycle accidents and poor infrastructure, and finally the possibility of improvement with a call to action.
  The design of the project also changed fairly significantly, with the color palette shifting and combining graphs related to comparing the DC to the US.
Data-wise, combining the graphs of how many accidents have happened in DC vs. how many have happened in the US as a whole. I previously had separate graphs for both, with an analysis of total accidents over time. Instead, I decided to divide the totals into “Accidents per 100,000” so that I could put two line graphs into the same plot and make it easier for the audience to see the drastic difference in trends.

## The audience

  My final audience for this project was DC Bicyclists and Constituents. Previously, I had three audiences I wanted to cover with my presentation: bikers, drivers, and policy makers. However, I found that it was a bit too broad and that my call to action wouldn’t be effective. So I shifted my focus to DC bikers and constituents. It allowed me to have a more focused story that was directed at people who had a clear motive and ability to take action in the issue I posed. This was something that was especially guided by my interviews: I found that my interviewee that was actually from DC had a far stronger reaction than the other two interviewees.
  The call to action has been changed dramatically by the end of Part III, both motivated by and resulting in the narrowing of audience. Before, I kind of vaguely pushed for self-education and policy changes. Now, I have a pre-filled email that is sent to the mayor’s office that directly addresses an Infrastructure Plan that needs to be brought back. Instead of “education,” I have a link to a newsletter subscription that educates on bike safety and advocacy in the DC area.

# Final thoughts

  This project was a very interesting journey. I am extremely glad I was able to pursue a subject that was personally important to me and directly related to my future. Within a day of this project being due, I'm heading to DC, so just the idea that I can actually see the things that I researched in action is exciting. I'm also excited to apply the skills in tableau and shorthand that I used in this project to my personal and professional life, specifically using Tableau as part of my work in consulting that I'm starting in June of 2024.
  If I could revisit this, I would examine more data about the United States as a whole. I was only able to thoroughly look at bicycle accidents in the city of DC and not statistics that go deep into the accidents seen throughout the country. If I was able to do that, I could do more thorough analyses and comparisons.
