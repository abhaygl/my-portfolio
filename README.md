# Welcome to My Portfolio!

This is a portal to the absolute peak of learning and creativity. This quarter A3, I will be using the power of Data in order to Tell Stories. Some may even saying I'm Telling Stories with Data.

# About me
Hi, my name is Abhay Liginlal and I'm a senior undergraduate Economics & Politics student at Carnegie Mellon. I was born in Madison, Wisconsin, but I grew up most of my life in Doha, Qatar. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music (big fan of Rock), playing videogames, and watching as many random informational YouTube videos as I can. I also love speech and debate: I competed in several championships for the South East Asian circuit of Forensics and I'm currently a senior member of the Carnegie Mellon Mock Trial team.

# What I hope to learn
There are four things I hope to learn as a part of this class:

1. Understand the usage of color (or its absence) in order to maximize the data communication in a visualization.

2. Learn basics of Tableau in order to kickstart my eventual usage of the program when I enter the consulting industry in Summer 2024.

4. Be able to criticize common data visualizations in the professional world and have ready solutions that I can quickly apply in my work life.

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
