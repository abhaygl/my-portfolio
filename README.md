# Welcome to My Portfolio!

This is a portal to the absolute peak of learning and creativity. This quarter A3, I will be using the power of Data in order to Tell Stories. Some may even say I'm Telling Stories with Data.

# About me
Hi, my name is Abhay Liginlal and I'm a senior undergraduate Economics & Politics student at Carnegie Mellon. I was born in Madison, Wisconsin, but I grew up most of my life in Doha, Qatar. In my free time, I enjoy listening to music (big fan of Rock), playing videogames, and watching as many random informational YouTube videos as I can. I also love speech and debate: I competed in several championships for the South East Asian circuit of Forensics and I'm currently a senior member of the Carnegie Mellon Mock Trial team.

# What I hope to learn
There are four things I hope to learn as a part of this class:

1 - Understand the usage of color (or its absence) in order to maximize the data communication in a visualization.

2 - Learn basics of Tableau in order to kickstart my eventual usage of the program when I enter the consulting industry in Summer 2024.

3 - Be able to criticize common data visualizations in the professional world and have ready solutions that I can quickly apply in my work life.
